## Deploy MicroTx Transaction Coordinator in Google Cloud

You can deploy MicroTx transaction coordinator after uploading the docker image of MicroTx.

1. Click **Deploy Container Button** to create Cloud Run Service.

2. Select the docker image that you have uploaded to Artifact Registory.

3. Note down the **Endpoint URL**. We will use this URL to set the internal and external address.

4. Edit the container port to 9000 and add the environment variables.

5. Deploy the service.

6. Check the health of the MicroTx transaction coordinator. Provide the host name and port number based on your environment.

    "coordinators": {
        "xaCoordinator": "Healthy",
        "lraCoordinator": "Healthy",
        "tccCoordinator": "Healthy"
        },
